Simple Plane Shooter Game using SDL library

This is a simple game project using C++ SDL and OpenGL library. This game is undone yet. 
What i mean by simple is that i made this game using a basic understading of C++ programming and the game itself is simple.
It's gameplay is similiar with Raiden game, a top-bottom scrolling shooter.

I made this project to help me and maybe other people in understanding about making video games from basic using C++ and OpenGL, not using some game engine like Unity, Unreal, etc.

In case you want to help me, you need OpenGL and SDL to be installed first.
